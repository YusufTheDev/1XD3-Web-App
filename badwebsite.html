                    <h3>The Reasons why this website is bad:</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Consistency</strong></li>
                            <p>This website has bad consistency as it has many web pages with designs that differ from
                                each other.</p>
                            <p>This is an issue as someone who is new to the website would have a hard time navigating
                                the website due to the lack of consisteny.<br><br></p>
                            <li><strong>Ease of Navigation</strong></li>
                            <p>Another issue with their website is that common objects are badly placed.</p>
                            <p>One example of this is the search bar on the home page, as it is quite small, doesn't
                                stand out much, and is placed under a lot of content which makes it hard to find.</p>
                            <p>Another prominent issue is that all of the different links look the same which is
                                actually bad as it makes it harder to differentiate the different links and as such
                                harder to navigate the page.<br><br></p>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Universal Usability</strong>
                            </li>
                            <p>The final main issue with the website is that although the website is readable on
                                desktop, the same cannot be said for other devices.</p>
                            <p>The text on the website is very small to the point that even on desktop it is hard to
                                read.</p>
                            <p>On a smaller device, the website zooms out further which makes reading any of the text
                                impossible, especially for those with eyesight issues.<br><br></p>
                            <p></p>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Overall, due to issues with consistency, ease of navigation, universal usability and in
                            general a boring and bland design, the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/?ref=nav_home">GoodReads</a> website, although being a large company,
                            has a bad web app experience and design.</h3>
